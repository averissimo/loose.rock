Verissimo r-package
===================

With personal functions I like to reuse everytime!

One of such is a proper function that capitalizes a string.

``` r
x <- "OnE oF sUcH iA a proPer function that capitalizes a string."
proper(x)
#> [1] "One Of Such Ia A Proper Function That Capitalizes A String."
```
