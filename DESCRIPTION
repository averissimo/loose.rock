Description: Collection of function to improve workflow in survival analysis and data science.
             Among the many features, the generation of balanced datasets, retrieval of protein 
             coding genes from two public databases (live) and generation of random matrix based
             on covariance matrix.
             The work has been mainly supported by two grants: FCT SFRH/BD/97415/2013 and
             the EU Commission under SOUND project with contract number 633974.
