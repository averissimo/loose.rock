Description: Collection of generic functions that can be used in data science.
             This has been developed during the PhD and is mostly because I'm 
             lazy and don't want to repeat myself.
             The work has been supported by FCT under grant SFRH/BD/97415/2013 and
             the EU Commission under SOUND project with contract number 633974.
